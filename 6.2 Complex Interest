#Problem: Take money borrowed, interest and duration as input. Then, compute the total amount repayable. 
#Step 1: Sets up variables
int_rate = float(input("Enter the interest rate for the loan."))
loan_val = int(input("Enter the amount borrowed."))
loan_dur = int(input("Enter the duration of the loan in years."))

#Step 2: Calculates total payable and outputs results
total = int((loan_val * int_rate / 100 * loan_dur) + loan_val)
print("There is $" + str(total) + " total payable on a loan of $" + str(loan_val) + " borrowed over " + str(loan_dur) + " years at " + str(int_rate) + "%")
