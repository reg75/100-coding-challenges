#Problem: For a list, find the second largest number in the list. 
#Step 1: Allows user to start creating a list of numbers.
numberlist = []
number = int(input("Type a number"))
numberlist.append(number)

#Step 2: Continues building list. Handles exception and gives user a way to end the loop.
while number != 0:

#Step 3: Finds and prints the second largest number from the list. 
numberlist.remove(max(numberlist))
