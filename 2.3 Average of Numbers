#Problem: Take numbers from a user and show the average of the numbers the user entered.

#Step 1: Ask user how many numbers they want to enter.
no_inputs = int(input("How many numbers do you want to find the average of?"))
inputted = 0
sum = 0

#Step 2: Input this number of numbers and find the sum of inputs.
while inputted < no_inputs:
  number = (int(input("Type a number")))
  sum += number
  inputted += 1
  

#Step 3: Find the average
average = sum / no_inputs
print("The average of your " + str(no_inputs) + " numbers is: " + str(average))
