#The Problem: Convert a decimal number to binary number. 

#Step 1: Takes an input, set up an exmpty string
x = int(input("Type a number that you would like converted to binary."))
deci = x
bin = ""

#Step 2: Builds binary number as a string, which needs to be reverse to give correct output.
while deci > 1:
  bin += str(deci % 2) #Add modulus of 2 to string
  deci = int((deci - (deci % 2)) / 2)
bin += str(deci)
bin = bin[::-1]

#Step 3: Outputs result
print(str(x) + " in binary is: " + bin)
