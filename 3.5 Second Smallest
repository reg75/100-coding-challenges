#Problem: For a list, find the second smallest number in the list. 
#Step 1: Allows user to start creating a list of numbers.
numberlist = []
number = int(input("Type a number"))
numberlist.append(number)

#Step 2: Continues building list. Handles exception and gives user a way to end the loop.
while number != 0:
    try:
      number = int(input("Type another number, or type 0 to find out the second smallest number you entered."))
      numberlist.append(number)
    except ValueError:
      print("Error. This is not a valid integer")

#Step 3: Finds and prints the second smallest number from the list. 
numberlist.remove(min(numberlist)) #removes zero
numberlist.remove(min(numberlist)) #removes smallest non-zero number
print("The second smallest number you entered was: " + str(min(numberlist)))
