#Problem: Take a number as input. Then get the sum of of the the squares of the number plus all preceding numbers.
#Step 1: Take a number n as input and create a range of numbers from 0-n 
n = int(input("Type a number"))
numberrange = (range(n + 1))
sum = 0

#Step 2: Finds the sum of the squares of all numbers from 0-n 
for i in numberrange:
  i = i**2
  sum += i

#Step 3: Outputs results.  
print("The sum of the squares of all numbers from 0 to " + str(n) + " is: " + str(sum))
