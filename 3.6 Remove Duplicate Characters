#Problem: For a given string, remove all duplicate characters.

#Step 1: Takes an input.
x = input("Type anything you want. This clever program will remove any duplicate characters.")

#Step 2: Creates an empty list and populates it with unique characters.
characters_used = []
for i in x:
  if i not in characters_used:
    characters_used.append(i)


#Step 3: Outputs unique characters.
print("With duplicates removed, this reads: " + (" ".join(characters_used)))
